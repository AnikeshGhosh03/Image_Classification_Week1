# Image_Classification_Week1
This project builds an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically identify and categorize images into predefined classes. The CNN learns spatial hierarchies of features through convolution, pooling, and activation layers to recognize patterns, textures, and objects accurately.
